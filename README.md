Akkazon Ekko
============

As a way of demonstrating how to write code with Scala, Akka,
and eventually functional programming (FP), I started 
creating this new Scala+Akka project.

I originally named it Alekka, because it’s like Amazon’s
Alexa — but written in Akka — but *Ekko* might be a little more
accurate because it’s more like the Amazon Echo product
than it is like the Alexa voice interaction, especially 
because it is not voice-controlled.

(For a voice-controlled, speech-interaction product like this, see
[Sarah, a voice-interaction assistant for Mac OS X](http://alvinalexander.com/sarah).)
